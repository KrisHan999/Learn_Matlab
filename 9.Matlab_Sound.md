# Matlab Sound

## 1.Read the audio file

1. `audioread`: Read audio file

   `[y,Fs] = audioread(filename)`

   returns sampled data `y` as an array, and a sample rate for that data `Fs`.

2. `audiowrite`: Write audio file

   `audiowrite(filename,y,Fs)`

   writes a matrix of audio data,`y`, with sample rate`Fs`to a file called`filename`.

3. `sound`: Convert matrix of signal data tosound

   ```matlab
   sound(y)
   sound(y,Fs)
   ```

## 2.Reverse the audio file

```matlab
% flipud: Flip array up to down
B = flipud(A)    
%%% returns A with its rows flipped in the up-down direction (that is, about a horizontal axis).

% fliplr: Flip array left to right
B = fliplr(A)
%%% returns A with its columns flipped in the left-right direction (that is, about a vertical axis).
```

## 3.Speed up the audio (downsample)

`downsample`: Decrease sample rate by integer factor

```matlab
y = downsample(x,n)
```
