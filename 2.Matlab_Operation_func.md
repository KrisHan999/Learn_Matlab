## 1.Matlab basic operations

1. basic math operations: "+ - * / ~"
   - "+" and "-" are element wise operations

   - "*" is to get the dot production

   - ".*" is to get the element wise production

   - "/" and "\" are special, not element wise

   - "./" and ".\" are element wise division

   - "mod" 取余： `mod(x, y)`

   - "~" 取反： `~0 = 1; ~1 = 0`

     ```matlab
     # for scalar value
     # A / B = B \ A
     1 / 3        
     ans = 0.3333
     
     1 \ 3
     ans = 3
     ```

## 2.Matlab functions and constants

1. matrix **inner(dot) and outer(cross) production**

   ```matlab
   >> A = [1 2 3];
   >> B = [1 2 3];
   >> dot(A, B)
   
   ans =
   
       14
   
   >> cross(A, B)
   
   ans =
   
        0     0     0
   ```

2. **Elementary function**: sin, cos, tan, exp, log...

   ```matlab
   # pass a scalar or a matrix
   # individually every element
   
   >> cos(0)
   
   ans =
   
        1
   
   >> cos([1,2,3,4])
   
   ans =
   
       0.5403   -0.4161   -0.9900   -0.6536
   ```

3. **Built in constants**

   ```matlab
   # pi
   >> pi
   
   ans =
   
       3.1416
   
   # 自然数 e
   >> exp(1)
   
   ans =
   
       2.7183
   
   # 复数 i 
   >> sqrt(-1)
   
   ans =
   
      0.0000 + 1.0000i
   
   >>
   ```

4. **Built in matrix functions**

   ```matlab
   >> zeros(3)
   
   ans =
   
        0     0     0
        0     0     0
        0     0     0
   
   >> ones(3)
   
   ans =
   
        1     1     1
        1     1     1
        1     1     1
   
   >> eye(3)
   
   ans =
   
        1     0     0
        0     1     0
        0     0     1
   
   >> A = [1 2 3; 4 5 6; 67 8 9];
   >> inv(A)
   
   ans =
   
       0.0167   -0.0333    0.0167
      -2.0333    1.0667   -0.0333
       1.6833   -0.7000    0.0167
       
   >> v = [1,2,3,4,5];
   >> diag(v)
   
   ans =
   
        1     0     0     0     0
        0     2     0     0     0
        0     0     3     0     0
        0     0     0     4     0
        0     0     0     0     5
   ```

## 3. Complex number

1. `real` returns real part of the complex number

2. `abs` returns the complex magnitude

## 4.random

1. `rng default`: initialize random number generator



## 5.flip the array

```matlab
B = flipud(A)
% returns A with its rows flipped in the up-down direction (that is, about a horizontal axis).

B = fliplr(A)
% returns A with its columns flipped in the left-right direction (that is, about a vertical axis).

B = flip(A)
% returns array B the same size as A, but with the order of the elements reversed.
B = flip(A,dim)
% reverses the order of the elements in A along dimension dim
```



## 6.reshape array

```matlab
B = reshape(A,sz)
% reshapes A using the size vector, sz, to define size(B).
```



## 7.meshgrid

```matlab
[X,Y] = meshgrid(x,y)
[X,Y] = meshgrid(x)
```

```matlab
[X,Y] = meshgrid(x,y) 
% returns 2-D grid coordinates based on the coordinates contained in vectors x and y. X is a matrix where each row is a copy of x, and Y is a matrix where each column is a copy of y. The grid represented by the coordinates X and Y has length(y) rows and length(x) columns.


[X,Y] = meshgrid(x) 
% is the same as [X,Y] = meshgrid(x,x), returning square grid coordinates with grid size length(x)-by-length(x).
```
